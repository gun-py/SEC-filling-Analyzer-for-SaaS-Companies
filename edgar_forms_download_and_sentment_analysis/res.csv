Randall K. Fields  Chairman and CEO of Park City Group commented  â€œAs planned  we delivered 99% recurring revenue as a SaaS model  giving us and our shareholders greater visibility and predictability to our topline. This is evident in the 7% increase in recurring revenue this quarter and 9% year to date. Elimination of non-recurring revenue and sunsetting ancillary and low-margin revenue streams supports our ongoing revenue strategy and strengthens our preparation for track and trace initiatives  certainly one of the largest opportunities in our companyâ€™s history. We also aligned our revenue strategy with spending  evident in our 149% increase in operating income  clearly demonstrating our emphasis on profitability and cash flow growth.â€
 
Mr. Fields continued  â€œWith growth in recurring revenue and continued decreases in our cash expenses  we have structural and predictable profitability and cash flow. We continue to leverage the company as the clear leader  and the obvious partner  to help the entire industry confront and address supply chain challenges  food safety compliance requirements. The FDA traceability mandates are coming either through FDA mandate or self-interest in the food industry. Interest in our track and trace capabilities remains robust  adoption of our compliance solutions as well as our supply chain services are all progressing. We are well-aligned with our customersâ€™ needs for transparency  traceability  supply chain and compliance. As the FDA requirements become clearer  I am confident we will be prepared to execute flawlessly.â€
 
Second Quarter Financial Results (three months ended December 31  2021  vs. three months ended December 31  2020): 
 
Total revenue decreased 16% to $4.4 million as compared to $5.2 million due to an approximate $1 million decrease in MarketPlace revenue and the planned elimination of all non-recurring revenue. This was partially offset by a 7% increase in core recurring SaaS revenue. Total operating expense decreased 29% to $3.4 million due to a decrease in cost of goods related to the lower MarketPlace revenue and lower operating expenses. GAAP net income was $872 000  versus $1.6 million. The prior-year quarter included a $1.1 million gain related to the forgiveness of the Companyâ€™s PPP loan. Excluding this non-recurring gain  net income would have increased 66%. GAAP net income to common shareholders was $725 000  or $0.04 per diluted share  compared to $1.5 million (inclusive of the $1.1 million non-recurring gain)  or $0.08 per diluted share.

This was partially offset by a 9% increase in core recurring SaaS revenue. Total operating expense decreased 28% to $6.8 million due to a decrease lower operating expenses and elimination of MarketPlace costs. GAAP net income was $1.8 million versus $2.2 million. The prior-year period included a $1.1 million gain related to the forgiveness of the Companyâ€™s PPP loan. Absent the one-time gain  net income increased 69%.

Thanks  Rob  and good afternoon  everyone.
 
The December quarter marked the completion of our three-year transition to a SaaS Company. Essentially  all of our revenue in the quarter  99%  was sold on a subscription basis. Hence  now all of our revenue is recurring. To put this in perspective  in 2018 only 64% of our revenue was recurring. MarketPlace revenue was volatile and highly unpredictable  and we sold software licenses and other lumpy onetime services. This made it very challenging for us and our Investors to predict quarter-on-quarter revenue  and provide any actionable line of sight to our profitability.
 
In 2019  our goal was to convert nonrecurring revenue to SaaS  while simultaneously reducing cash expenses  making our business much easier to forecast and more profitable. We have achieved that. It was a bold goal. It was difficult. It was methodical. We heavily invested in technology and process with a superior team  just 64 people and we utilized our own technology  replacing third-party CRM providers  antiquated contract storage partners  scrutinizing and eliminating waste  and streamlined every process from contract to cash. Nonetheless  as I have said before  from time to time  there will always be a customer that insists on buying meaning license versus renting  meaning SaaS subscription. However  that occurrence should be few and far between. We have structured our sales process and pricing models to encourage the sale of SaaS solutions wherever possible.
 
Going forward  our current baseline recurring revenue  together with our stated goal to grow recurring revenue at approximately 10% to 20% annually should serve as a model for predictable topline growth for us and our Shareholders. It should be noted that consolidated revenue in the quarter reflects the absence of $1 million in non-recurring MarketPlace revenue and sunsetting vendor-based pricing which accounted for $650 000 annually in revenue and $200 000 in the quarter.
 
Eliminating one-time revenue and ancillary efforts enables us to reallocate and realign resources to prepare for one of the largest opportunities in the Companyâ€™s history  providing our customers a cost effective solution for the anticipated FDAâ€™s food traceability mandate. Please note that despite our recurring revenue achievements  we will commonly experience volatility on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We have seasonal vendors. There is constant consolidation in the grocery industry we serve. Consequently  some quarters will be higher and some quarters lower. In any event  we maintain our goal to grow our recurring revenue at 10% to 20% annually.
 
In addition to growth in recurring revenue  we continue to reduce our cash operating expenses. Total operating expenses decreased 29% year-over-year  partly due to lower cost of goods sold associated with one-time MarketPlace sales  but largely due to continued expense management  and permanent expense reductions in our SG&A and R&D lines  which we have previously communicated. The net result is systemic profitability.
 
As I have said before  each incremental revenue dollar over our $11 million to $12 million and fixed cash costs now $11 million  largely falls to the bottom line. You can see that in our revenue per employee  $305 000 each  84% higher than the industry average. You can see that in the cash we are generating  $3.1 million in the first six months of this fiscal year and $2 million in the second fiscal quarter alone. This validates the leverage and the model  in other words  our cash profitability grew substantially faster than revenue.
 
Our net income  excluding the one-time benefit from the forgiveness of our PPP loan in the prior year second quarter increased 66% on a decrease in consolidated revenue. The earnings power of the Company is now clear and easy to model. As we grow our top line  we should grow our bottom line even faster. Highlights as of December 31 are as follows. Total revenue decreased 16% to $4.4 million due to lower MarketPlace revenue and sunsetting of ancillary products. This was the plan.
 
Recurring revenue for our SaaS business  which includes compliance and supply chain was up 7% to $4.3 million for the quarter and 9% year-to-date. Recurring revenue now represents 99% of total revenue. Total expenses decreased 29% due to lower across-the-board costs. Operating income surged 148%. Net income  excluding the non-recurring $1.1 million gain on the forgiveness of our PPP loan  increased 66%. Our net income for the quarter was $872 000 or $0.04 per diluted share.

Cash from operations was nearly $2 million. We bought back 244 000 shares of stock and we ended the quarter with $21.7 million in cash in the bank. Park City Group is now a SaaS Company. The transactional revenue which created volatility in our quarter-to-quarter revenue and a drag on our margins has now shifted to a SaaS model. To summarize  we have a combination of proven solutions that enables customers to be compliant  provide more actionable visibility into their supply chain  replace vendors and source hard-to-find items now  all on a subscription basis.
 
Turning to the quarterly numbers  Fiscal Year 2022 second quarter revenue was $4.4 million  down 16% from $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease was due to $1.2 million lower revenue as part of our strategic plan  as Iâ€™ve already discussed. Recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 99% for the quarter or $4.3 million. This is a 7% increase over the same period in Fiscal 2021. Total operating expenses decreased 29% from $4.8 million in Q2 2021  to $3.4 million in Q2 2022. The decrease is due to lower across the Board costs.
 
Sales and marketing expenses decreased from $1.2 million in Q2 2021 to $1.15 million in Q2 2022. This decrease was the result of lower sales travel  trade shows and cost reductions. G&A costs were essentially flat at $1.2 million. For the second quarter of Fiscal 2022  GAAP net income was $872 000 or 20% of revenue versus $1.6 million last year  which included the $1.1 million benefit for the forgiveness of our PPP loan. Excluding this gain  net income in the second quarter last year was $524 000 or 10% of revenue. For the second quarter in a row  weâ€™ve essentially doubled our net margin.
 
Net income to common Shareholders was $725 000 or $0.04 per common share versus $1.5 million or $0.08 per common share. Again  the prior year quarter includes the impact of the PPP loan forgiveness.
 
Turning to the six-month numbers. Fiscal Year 2022  year-to-date revenue was $8.9 million  down 14% from $10.4 million in the same period last year. Recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 98% for the six months or $8.7 million. This is a 9% increase over the same period of Fiscal 2021. Total operating expenses decreased 28% from $9.4 million to $6.8 million for the first six months of Fiscal 2022. Sales and marketing expenses decreased from $2.4 million in 2021 to $2.3 million in Fiscal 2022. Again  G&A costs were essentially flat at $2.3 million.
 
Year-to-date  GAAP net income was $1.82 million or 20% of revenue versus $2.18 million inclusive of the $1.1 million gain on the forgiveness of our PPP loan. Excluding this  net income in the second quarter last year was $1.1 million or 11% of revenue. So again for the second quarter in a row  we have essentially doubled or net margin. Year-to-date GAAP net income to common Shareholders was $1.53 million or $0.08 per common share versus $1.88 million or $0.10 per common share last year  which again includes the impact of the PPP loan forgiveness.
 
Turning now to cash flow and cash balances. For the fiscal second quarter we generated cash from operations of $2 million. Total cash at December 31  20 21  was $21.7 million  compared to $24 million at the end of Fiscal Year 2021. The decrease in total cash was due to the payoff of a $6 million credit facility with a bank during the first quarter. The Company now carries approximately $930 000 in short-term debt on its revolving line of credit. The short-term debt was used to buy back additional shares of stock.
 
During the quarter we repurchase 244 552 shares at an average price of $5.85 per share for a total of $1.43 million. To-date  the Company has repurchased 1 002 914 shares at an average price of $5.06 per share for a total of $5.7 million. The Company has approximately $10.5 million remaining on the $12 million buyback authorization.
 
Thanks  everyone  for your time today. At this point  Iâ€™ll pass the call over to Randy. Randy?
 
Randy Fields
 
Thanks  John.
 
As John pointed out  we achieved the non-trivial task of converting basically all of our revenue to recurring revenue. We did this without sacrificing our profitability during that transition. In fact  weâ€™ve meaningfully increased our profitability and our cash generation. Weâ€™ve always believed that cash is king. During uncertain times  we think profitability and cash generation are even more important.

Recurring revenue grew 7% in the quarter  nearly 9% for the first six months of the year and we expect it to grow at least 10% for the full year. Since we made this strategic decision to convert one-time revenue into a recurring revenue model  wherever possible  enabling us to focus on our SaaS revenue  our growth rate for recurring revenue has been around 15%. Thatâ€™s exactly the midpoint of the range that weâ€™re targeting long-term. Itâ€™s important to recognize that our growth rate in the quarter reflects several strategic decisions. In the year ago quarter  one-time  low margin MarketPlace revenue was about a $1 million. In fact  you can already see that weâ€™re making progress in our quarterly margins.
 
Secondly  it reflects the strategic decision to sunset certain services that  although they were substantial in terms of current revenue  had less long-term growth potential  and frankly  were distractions to the more exciting areas of opportunity for us. The impact is about $700 000 this year  about 4% of our total. By exiting this product  we sacrifice a small amount of quarterly revenue  but we free up resources for the much larger opportunity coming down the pike  traceability. We have continued preparing for the Companyâ€™s Track & Trace initiative. It is going to be a significant opportunity for us  uniquely  in my opinion  for us  and the FDA mandates will effectively do much of the marketing for us.
 
The proposed Rule 204 imposes burdensome new requirements for those who manufacture  process  pack or hold the products on whatâ€™s called the Food Traceability List. Thereâ€™s about 16 categories of items on this list from the FDA  such as eggs  soft cheese  herbs  leafy greens  et cetera. Please note  the FDA has specifically said that paper-based systems are no longer sufficient. They are mandating truly an electronic solution. Our niche in traceability is important and we will augment what many others in this field are doing. We believe we will play a very important role in the industryâ€™s move to solving the problem of end-to-end traceability.
 
Traceability requires massive micro execution  the ability to process and handle literally tens of billions of transactions per year  and do it at the same time accurately quickly electronically and in a fully automated fashion. Since we already do Track & Trace successfully  affordably and at scale  as part of our supply chain platform  this opportunity is squarely in our wheelhouse. Park City Group has more than a decade of tracing compliance and supply chain challenges. Accordingly  we are the obvious vendor to address it.
 
In a sense  traceability is a marriage of compliance and supply chain. Itâ€™s like this challenge  in fact  was actually designed for us. Importantly  as we prepare our traceability solution  weâ€™re leveraging our experience in the industry  our relationships with our retail and supplier customers  and the lessons weâ€™ve learned in rolling out compliance and Supply Chain solutions at scale across the industry. Our business model for traceability is incredibly simple  make it very low cost and exceptionally easy to adopt.
 
We know that simplicity and low cost are the keys in this industry for adoption  and we know that we can generate meaningful revenue and profitability  even at a low monthly subscription rate. We already have the systems in place  so no major development is needed. Thatâ€™s key. Any new entrants into the market place canâ€™t match that advantage  think about it  a proven scale and already connected to a vast network of suppliers and retailers. As has always been the case weâ€™re focused on our customers and what they need. We know them  and they know and trust us. Weâ€™re up to the challenge.
 
In reality  these mandates will just expand the scope and increase the importance of adoption. It wonâ€™t be optional anymore. To put this in context  given our existing 25 000 plus customer base  weâ€™ve identified something in the order of 6 000 suppliers  whose products may be initially affected by Rule 204. Even at a modest subscription rate  this opportunity will be a substantial add-on to our current $20 million a year of SaaS revenue. The size of this  the compressed timeline  the mandates that are being created and the massive impact on our customers and their suppliers requires us to pull all hands on deck to perfect the rollout of our solution now. This validates our decision to de-emphasize certain non-core offerings.
 
We arenâ€™t  however  expecting meaningful revenue from traceability in this fiscal year  the regulations will be finalized by November and that will be the starting gun. In fact  none of our internal models require any contribution from traceability to achieve our goals of 10% to 20% a year revenue growth. This is the year we do the hard work without any traceability revenue. This is the year we do everything we need to be fully ready  to be able to implement this at scale with our customers and itâ€™s important for us therefore to be organized around their needs. The FDAs timeline makes this a top priority for us and even more so for our customers. Weâ€™ve been doing a series of tests that weâ€™ve mentioned  with our customers and no surprise  obviously  itâ€™s all going very well  exactly as we planned.

Simultaneously  weâ€™re continuing the cross-selling activities that weâ€™ve mentioned on prior calls. Weâ€™ve had several successes this quarter. Our largest user of Out of Stock management recently expanded their agreement with us. Our Out of Stock solution is increasingly contributing to our core SaaS revenue and it provides a valuable service for our customers in a world increasingly dominated by Amazon.
 
Our Tier 2 program is growing quite rapidly in terms of numbers and revenue. Most importantly  seriously most importantly  our execution continues to be something that as Shareholders we can all be proud of. Interestingly  most of our largest customers are growing the use of our services quite rapidly. That certainly speaks volumes about how well our team is delivering on our brand promise. When traceability becomes a reality  it will be our largest customers who roll out traceability first. Our long-term relationships and our laser focus on keeping our customers delighted and successful is perhaps our most durable competitive moat.
 
We have a fortress balance sheet  seriously. We are structurally profitable  with growing recurring revenue that significantly exceeds our cash operating expenses and the leverage thatâ€™s inherent in the model and enables us to grow profitably and cash faster than revenue. We have made and continue to make significant investments in our own internal technology and systems. Our proprietary tech is massively increased the measurable productivity of our team. Thatâ€™s why our revenue per employee is so high  and in fact  that number should continue to climb over time.
 
Our method of continually examining costs and automating the administration across the business is actually a very important competitive advantage for us. Our aim is to continue to grow our GAAP earnings at a very rapid rate. We recognize that our conservative nature makes understanding us a little bit harder. But weâ€™re in an environment where conservatism we believe is and will be rewarded. Our Company should now be much easier to understand and much more likely to be appreciated. Every product area of our business is growing.
 
Our pipeline of prospective new business is excellent and weâ€™re attracting a very high caliber of new staff. We are accelerating our revenue and expect to see continued improvement over the next several quarters. But to reiterate  our key goals for this fiscal year are  one  be ready for the Track & Trace solution before the mandate. Two  continue to add modules to our existing applications. This gives us an even broader portfolio of solutions that we can sell to our customers. In fact  even the traceability product already has a roadmap to additional modules or add-ons in our plan.
 
Our focus is simple  continue to generate additional profitability  drive cash and buyback stock. Weâ€™ve achieved a lot in the last year. Weâ€™ve done it in the midst of obviously difficult global pandemic and deep supply chain disruptions. Iâ€™m incredibly proud of the team and how weâ€™ve navigated this transition to a full SaaS model  and at the same time  maintaining very high levels of customer success and satisfaction  and at the same time  our own growth and profitability. Given our opportunities  Iâ€™m very optimistic for Fiscal 2022 and I believe you should be too.
 
With that  Iâ€™d like to now open the call for questions. Operator?
 
Operator
 
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tom Forte with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.
 
Tom Forte
 
Great. Randy and John  thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter.
 
Iâ€™ll go one at a time to make it easy. First one is the one Iâ€™m consistently asking. Randy and John  can you talk about the state of distraction for your core customer  given the current challenges today? Randy  you talked about inter-quarter promotion that a lot of the food retailers were challenged with Omicron from a labor shortage standpoint  but is that affecting at all your sales cycle?
 
Randy Fields
 
The answer really was contained in the statement that I made that all of our products now seem to be coming alive. Our pipeline is superb. The labor issues remain. People still need more staff than they have and that affects the entire supply chain. Most food retailers still have a lot of focus on supply chain. Thereâ€™s a tiny bit of evidence that itâ€™s beginning to free up a bit. But fortunately  I think  the worst is behind us.

Tom Forte
 
Second question is  you have talked about the pivot to recurring revenue. From an expense standpoint  if youâ€™re successful in exploiting the opportunity on traceability  how would that affect  if at all  your operating expenses?
 
Randy Fields
 
Well  I think  John and I are of the belief thatâ€”and I think the way he stated it  I certainly agree with that  from here forward  80% plus of our additional revenue will become cash and income. We expect that thereâ€™s some variable expenses with what weâ€™ll be doing  but not substantial. It will not impact our margins negatively  I would say.
 
Tom Forte
 
All right. Then third and final one  from a capital allocation standpoint  how should we think about buybacks? How should we think about potential M&A? I know you have talked a lot about using your free cash flow to buy back more shares  but are there opportunities to add products to complement what you have today or any other potential uses of capital?
 
Randy Fields
 
John  you want to take that?
 
John Merrill
 
Yes. I think weâ€™ve said it on previous calls that the cash that we generate quarterly we would take half of that cash and buyback additional shares of stock  put the rest of it in the bank. That may change from quarter-to-quarter  but looking back that is our goal to take half the cash and buy back stock. As far as the traceability or other initiatives  I donâ€™t see more headcount. As Randy pointed out  it doesnâ€™t require more development. We are already doing traceability. I think last quarter we talked about expenses going down. If you would ask  were they permanent  the answer is yes.
 
Then in my statement  we had always said  it takes $12 million to keep the Company alive and that weâ€™ve now reduced that down to $11 million. That is permanent. I donâ€™t see that changing going forward with traceability. As far as M&A  weâ€™re always acquisitive  but with revenue multiples right now  I donâ€™t see anything that makes sense thatâ€”we have plenty on our plate  letâ€™s put it that way without M&A.
 
Tom Forte
 
Excellent. Thanks for taking my questions.
 
Operator
 
We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Iâ€™ll now turn the call back over to Randy for closing remarks.
 
Randy Fields
 
Okay  Doug. Thank you. We appreciate everybody taking time this afternoon. I think the only question that wasnâ€™t raised is the likelihood of the traceability initiative coming to fruition with a government mandate  and perhaps we should have explained in our commentary. We see no way that the government can exit the road that itâ€™s on. Itâ€™s laid down a proposed rule. Weâ€™re sure thereâ€™ll be some tweaking around the edges  but traceability is going to happen. We actually think that weâ€™ve developed a way to help the industry use traceability to its economic advantage rather than disadvantage. Weâ€™re finding the market even more receptive to what weâ€™re doing than we originally had guessed.
 
Full speed ahead  and thanks  everybody  for taking time this afternoon. Weâ€™ll talk to you all next quarter. Thank you.
 
Operator
 
This concludes todayâ€™s conference and you may disconnect your line at this time. Thank you for your participation.
