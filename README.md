# SEC-filling-Analyzer-for-SaaS-Companies
IIT Dhanbad @InterIIT 10.0 | Bronze Medal Solution | Digital Alphaâ€™s Problem Statement

SaaS companies are customer-driven and are heavily dependent on their customer base. There are a set of metrics that can showcase the health of the SaaS companies and their aspects. These metrics and numbers are not readily available on publicly reported SEC Filings and need to be chalked out from the available forms (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, etc.). Accessing these metrics can be of tremendous value to the right users. Forms that are being filed are very detailed and take time to analyze. For analyzing a form, the primary task is chalking out the key SaaS numbers. There is a need to have simplified dashboards to have a quick overview of Key SaaS Goals.

- 10K: It is an annual report of the company. Footnotes in 10K forms can help to flag sketchy accounting practices.
- 10Q: It is the company's quarterly report that reflects changes in inventory and working capital. It can be used to draw comparisons between companies.
- 8K: Used for important announcements, like executive appointments, etc., between filings of a majority of forms - investors will get non-financial inputs, for example,       when TATA sons had a management change or similar situations.
