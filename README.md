# SEC-filling-Analyzer-for-SaaS-Companies
IIT Dhanbad @InterIIT 10.0 | Bronze Medal Solution | Digital Alphaâ€™s Problem Statement

SaaS companies are customer-driven and are heavily dependent on their customer base. There are a set of metrics that can showcase the health of the SaaS companies and their aspects. These metrics and numbers are not readily available on publicly reported SEC Filings and need to be chalked out from the available forms (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, etc.). Accessing these metrics can be of tremendous value to the right users. Forms that are being filed are very detailed and take time to analyze. For analyzing a form, the primary task is chalking out the key SaaS numbers. There is a need to have simplified dashboards to have a quick overview of Key SaaS Goals.

- 10K: It is an annual report of the company. Footnotes in 10K forms can help to flag sketchy accounting practices.
- 10Q: It is the company's quarterly report that reflects changes in inventory and working capital. It can be used to draw comparisons between companies.
- 8K: Used for important announcements, like executive appointments, etc., between filings of a majority of forms - investors will get non-financial inputs, for example,       when TATA sons had a management change or similar situations.

# Features
- The dashboard should have a search bar to enter the required query by the user - company
name, date range, metrics, type, etc.
- Key SaaS goal analyzer can be based on growth, profitability, potential, etc.
- The dashboard should showcase the drill-down map of the Key SaaS goals of the searched
company for the specified date range.
- For unavailable data, the participating team should choose appropriate alternative resources.
- Table of Content: Break down the lengthy SEC filings into separate sections, each of which
deals with different aspects of a company's reporting, making it easy to navigate.
- ML model to be trained and implemented in the web tool for any chosen usage - Example:
- Analyze the Annual report for the given time frame to get the sentiment from the SEC filings to
assess the company's situation.
- Come up with a single call API that creates a dataset in a few lines of code for any duration of
time and numerous tickers. The extracted data frame must be written as a CSV file and
downloaded.
- Graphs and charts to showcase the trends and changes in metrics for a given date range.
- Metrics classification for SaaS companies- Good, bad, or neutral for each drill-down tab.
- Competitor comparison page - Dashboard with a feature to compare two or more companies
for the same date range with trend graph overlay and key SaaS goal drill-down overlay.
- The web tool must be hosted using standard hosting solutions and databases only.
